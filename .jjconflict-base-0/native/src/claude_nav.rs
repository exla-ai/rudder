//! Message-by-message scrolling of a Claude Code worker's normal view, driven
//! by what Rudder sees on the worker's screen.
//!
//! Rudder can't compute message boundaries itself: Claude Code is a fullscreen
//! TUI on the alternate screen, so the pane has no scrollback to scan. Its
//! normal view does scroll (PageUp = half a page, mouse wheel = one line, and
//! Claude asks for SGR mouse reporting so Rudder can send wheel events), but
//! it has no "previous message" key, and its transcript pager's `{`/`}` step
//! by *prompt* — useless for a worker, which gets one prompt and then a long
//! turn of tool calls (that shipped: the first press jumped to the top and the
//! rest did nothing). Switching into that pager was also a mode change the
//! user didn't want.
//!
//! So Rudder walks the normal view the way a person would: page up, look at
//! what came into view, and if a message start (`⏺` or a `❯` prompt) that was
//! above the old top of the screen is now visible, wheel down one line at a
//! time until it sits at the top. If nothing came into view, page up again.
//! This module holds the byte constants and the pure screen math; the state
//! machine that sends the keys and waits for repaints lives in main.rs
//! (`ClaudeMessageNav`).
//!
//! Measured against claude 2.1.27x through Rudder's own pane: while scrolled,
//! Claude pins the current prompt as a sticky line on row 0 and shows a "Jump
//! to bottom" hint on the last content row; the first wheel event after a
//! change of direction is dropped; a message scrolled past the top slides
//! under the sticky line (it isn't blanked, unlike in the transcript pager).
