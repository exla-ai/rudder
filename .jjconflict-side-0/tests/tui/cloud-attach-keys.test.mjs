// `rudder cloud attach` has to set up the LOCAL terminal on the remote
// dashboard's behalf.
//
// The remote TUI asks for the kitty keyboard protocol exactly once, in its own
// setup_terminal(), and the worker supervisor only keeps the TAIL of its output
// (256KB). By the time you attach, that request is long evicted — it never
// reaches your terminal. The mouse modes already had this bug and were fixed by
// enabling them locally; the keyboard flags had not been.
//
// The user-visible symptom: ⌥h stops hiding panes in cloud. Without the
// protocol, macOS terminals report Option+h as the character it TYPES (˙ on a
// US layout), not as Alt+h, and the dashboard only honours the bare ˙ outside
// the task pane — which is the pane you start in. Alt+[ / Alt+] cannot be
// encoded at all: ESC-[ is the CSI introducer.
//
// So: assert the real CLI, in a real PTY, pushes the flags on connect and pops
// them on the way out.
