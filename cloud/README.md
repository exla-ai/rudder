# Rudder Cloud

Rudder Cloud is the control plane for `/login`, `/cloud`, and `/sail`.

The CLI package stays light. This service is a separate deployable app that uses
Better Auth for Google and GitHub login, then issues a Rudder CLI token for the
local dashboard.

## Quickstart (copy/paste)

```bash
npm install -g @exla-ai/rudder@latest
rudder login                                  # opens the cloud login
rudder cloud "fix the failing tests"          # launches a fresh cloud instance
rudder cloud list                             # see every instance on your account
rudder cloud talk <id> "what are you doing?"  # message any instance, see its reply
rudder cloud output <id>                      # latest output from an instance
rudder cloud attach <id>                      # full interactive terminal
```

`rudder cloud quickstart` prints this list at any time.

## Talk to instances (HTTP relay)

Every running instance keeps a worker WebSocket open to the control plane. Two
endpoints let you converse with it without a full interactive attach — this is
what `rudder cloud talk` and the Slack bot use:

```text
POST /api/rudder/sail/:id/input    { "text": "...", "submit": true }
GET  /api/rudder/sail/:id/output   -> { id, connected, output }
```

Both require the account's CLI bearer token and instance ownership. `input`
injects the text into the agent's PTY exactly as a keystroke (with a trailing
carriage return when `submit` is not `false`); `output` returns the recent
replay buffer.

## Slack — the shared "main panel"

A single Slack channel becomes the control surface for every cloud instance on
the account. Each instance opens its own **thread** in the channel: launching
announces it, the agent's final result posts into the thread, and **replying in
a thread sends your message straight to that instance**. You can also drive it
with `list`, `talk <id> <message>`, `output <id>`, and `stop <id>`.

Default channel: `C0B78TDLM5G` (override with `RUDDER_SLACK_CHANNEL`).

Set up in three steps (or run `rudder cloud slack` for the guided version):

```bash
# 1. Create a Slack app from the manifest:
rudder cloud slack manifest          # prints a JSON manifest to paste at api.slack.com/apps

# 2. Install it, then invite the bot to the channel:
#    /invite @rudder   (in C0B78TDLM5G)

# 3. Give the control plane the credentials and redeploy:
flyctl secrets set \
  SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-... \
  SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=... \
  RUDDER_SLACK_CHANNEL=C0B78TDLM5G \
  -a rudder-cloud-control
```

The events request URL is `https://<control-plane>/api/slack/events`. Inbound
requests are verified with `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` (v0 signature, 5-minute replay
window) and deduped by Slack `event_id`.

## Environment

```bash
BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://cloud.example.com
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=<random secret>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<google oauth client id>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<google oauth client secret>
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<github oauth client id>
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<github oauth client secret>
RUDDER_CLOUD_DATA_DIR=/data
RUDDER_S3_BUCKET=<snapshot bucket>
RUDDER_CLOUD_STATE_KEY=control-plane/rudder-cloud.sqlite
RUDDER_CLOUD_PERSIST_STATE=1
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
FLY_API_TOKEN=<fly token>
FLY_APP_NAME=<existing fly machines app>
FLY_REGION=iad
RUDDER_WORKER_IMAGE=<registry image for cloud/worker/Dockerfile>
RUDDER_SECRETS_KEY=<32 random bytes, base64 — enables the secrets vault>
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=<xoxb- bot token, enables the Slack control surface>
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=<verifies inbound Slack events>
RUDDER_SLACK_CHANNEL=C0B78TDLM5G
```

`SLACK_*` are optional; when `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` is unset the Slack surface is
simply disabled. See "Slack — the shared main panel" below.

`FLY_API_TOKEN` and `FLY_APP_NAME` are only required for the managed Fly
Machines runtime. BYOC runs still require `RUDDER_S3_BUCKET` and
`RUDDER_WORKER_IMAGE` so the control plane can store a snapshot and print a
worker command for the user's server.

`RUDDER_SECRETS_KEY` is the KEK for the per-account secrets vault
(`rudder cloud secrets ...`). Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32` and set
it via `flyctl secrets set`. **Back it up out-of-band**: losing it makes all
stored vault ciphertext unreadable (recovery = re-run `rudder cloud secrets
sync` from a laptop that still has the credentials). When unset, the vault
endpoints return 503 and clients fall back to carrying credentials inside
workspace snapshots (the legacy behavior, also forceable with
`RUDDER_CLOUD_LEGACY_SNAPSHOT_SECRETS=1` on the client).

```

Generated AWS secrets:

- `rudder/better-auth-secret`
- `rudder/fly-api-token`

Google/GitHub OAuth client IDs and client secrets still need to be created in
the provider consoles and added as Fly secrets before the hosted login flow
can go live.

Until provider OAuth clients are installed, login still works through an
already-authenticated GitHub CLI or GitHub's device flow. `rudder login` sends
the resulting GitHub token to `/api/cli/login/github-token`; the server verifies
it with GitHub and stores only a hashed Rudder Cloud token. The hosted
`/cli/login` page also exposes a GitHub device-login path so browser login does
not dead-end while Google/GitHub Better Auth provider secrets are missing.

GitHub browser OAuth can be configured from the hosted setup page without
copying secrets by hand:

```text
https://rudder-cloud-control.fly.dev/setup/github
https://rudder-cloud-control.fly.dev/setup/github?org=exla
```

That page uses GitHub's App Manifest flow to create a GitHub App, receives the
generated OAuth client ID and secret at `/setup/github/callback`, stores them in
Rudder Cloud's persisted state, and rebuilds Better Auth dynamically. The normal
GitHub browser login button appears on `/cli/login` immediately after setup.

If the GitHub App already exists, generate a fresh client secret from the app
settings page and install the existing app credentials from a logged-in admin
CLI:

```bash
rudder cloud login
rudder cloud setup-github <client-id>
```

The CLI prompts for the client secret without echoing it. For scripts, set
`RUDDER_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `RUDDER_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`.

Google browser OAuth can be installed the same way after creating an OAuth web
client with this redirect URI:

```text
https://rudder-cloud-control.fly.dev/api/auth/callback/google
```

```bash
rudder cloud login
rudder cloud setup-google <client-id>
```

The CLI prompts for the Google client secret without echoing it. For scripts,
set `RUDDER_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `RUDDER_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.

The setup endpoint is restricted to `RUDDER_ADMIN_EMAILS` (defaults to
`viraat.laldas@gmail.com,viraat@exla.ai`) and persists the credentials to S3
before returning.

OAuth callback URLs:

```text
https://cloud.example.com/api/auth/callback/google
https://cloud.example.com/api/auth/callback/github
```

## Local

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

Then point the CLI at it:

```bash
export RUDDER_CLOUD_URL=http://localhost:3000
rudder login
rudder cloud list
```

## AWS

The AWS role of the control plane is S3 snapshot storage. The service stores
uploaded launch/onload snapshots in `RUDDER_S3_BUCKET` using server-side
encryption and gives each Fly Machine a one-hour presigned URL. Fly workers do
not receive AWS credentials.

The control plane also persists its SQLite state to S3 at
`RUDDER_CLOUD_STATE_KEY` by default. That keeps CLI tokens, sail records, worker
heartbeats, and Better Auth tables available across control-plane restarts
without requiring a database server. Set `RUDDER_CLOUD_PERSIST_STATE=0` to
disable that behavior for local development.

## Hosting

The control plane runs on a single Fly Machine in the `rudder-cloud-control`
app. WebSocket Upgrade is required for `cloud attach`, so the host must not
strip Upgrade headers. The Fly Machines API is used for both this app and the
worker app, but they are separate apps — the control plane reads
`RUDDER_FLY_APP_NAME` (workers app, e.g. `rudder-workers-exla`) rather than
`FLY_APP_NAME`, which Fly auto-injects with the running app's own name.

Deploy with:

```bash
cd cloud
flyctl deploy --remote-only
```

`fly.toml` carries the env block; secrets (`BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`,
`FLY_API_TOKEN`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`,
`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) live in `flyctl secrets`.

## Fly Machines

Rudder Cloud creates one Fly Machine per sail through the Fly Machines API.
`FLY_APP_NAME` must point at an existing Fly app, and `RUDDER_WORKER_IMAGE`
should be an image built from `worker/Dockerfile`.

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  -f cloud/worker/Dockerfile \
  -t public.ecr.aws/exla/rudder-worker:latest \
  --push .

docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 \
  -f cloud/worker/Dockerfile \
  -t public.ecr.aws/exla/rudder-worker:arm64 \
  --push .
```

When the local docker VM has no room for an amd64 build (it runs under
emulation on Apple Silicon), build on Fly's remote builder instead and point
`RUDDER_WORKER_IMAGE` at the Fly registry, which the workers app can pull
from directly:

```bash
printf 'app = "rudder-workers-exla"\n' > /tmp/fly-worker.toml
FLY_API_TOKEN="$(awk '/^access_token:/{print $2}' ~/.fly/config.yml)" \
  flyctl deploy --config /tmp/fly-worker.toml --dockerfile cloud/worker/Dockerfile \
  --build-only --push --remote-only --image-label <version> .
# -> registry.fly.io/rudder-workers-exla:<version>
# mirror an arm64 build under the same name so the `:arm64` derivation resolves:
docker buildx imagetools create -t registry.fly.io/rudder-workers-exla:arm64 \
  public.ecr.aws/exla/rudder-worker:<version>-arm64
```

The worker image installs Rudder, acpx, and Hunk at startup, downloads the
snapshot from S3, restores selected HOME config, and starts `rudder run
--worktree "$RUDDER_TASK"` inside the unpacked repo. Agent CLIs are installed
as the non-root `rudder` user (Claude Code through its native installer, the
npm ones under a home npm prefix) and the entrypoint runs a bounded
`claude update` at every boot, so a worker runs the current Claude Code even
on an image tag built weeks earlier. `RUDDER_WORKER_SKIP_AGENT_UPDATE=1`
turns that off.

## Bring Your Own VM

Users can run Rudder Cloud workers on their own workstation or server instead
of Fly Machines:

```bash
rudder cloud login
rudder cloud setup-byoc rudder-workstation
rudder cloud "fix the failing migration"
```

`setup-byoc` expects an SSH host that is available from `~/.ssh/config`, uses
key-based auth, and has Docker available to the SSH user. It stores `byoc` as
the local default runtime for that CLI login, plus the SSH host for automatic
worker startup.
Future `/cloud <task>`, `/sail <task>`, and `rudder cloud <task>` launches
upload the same snapshot but return a `docker run` command instead of calling
the Fly Machines API. If an SSH host is configured, the CLI starts that command
on the host with `nohup`; otherwise it prints the command for manual execution.
It passes `RUDDER_SNAPSHOT_URL`, `RUDDER_WORKER_TOKEN`, `RUDDER_CLOUD_URL`, and
task metadata into `cloud/worker/entrypoint.sh`, which already reports
heartbeats and completion back to the control plane.

Useful commands:

```bash
rudder cloud runtime            # show fly or byoc
rudder cloud runtime fly        # switch back to Fly Machines
rudder cloud byoc "task"        # prepare one BYOC run without changing default
rudder cloud bootstrap <sailId> # regenerate an expired BYOC command
```

Set `RUDDER_BYOC_AUTOSTART=0` to force the CLI to print the Docker command
instead of starting it over SSH.
