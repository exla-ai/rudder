#![allow(unused_imports)]
//! Publishing reviewed work to GitHub as draft pull requests.
//!
//! Rudder's road to main used to be exactly one: `m` merged a reviewed workspace
//! into the user's local checkout, and nothing ever left the machine. Publishing
//! is the second road, and the rule is that a repo has ONE of them, never both:
//! where publishing can work (a GitHub remote, `gh` present and logged in), `m`
//! opens a pull request instead of merging locally. Where it cannot, `m` merges
//! locally exactly as before. Two roads for the same row would mean work landing
//! in main twice, by two different mechanisms, with no single place to look for
//! "did this ship?".
//!
//! Three things this module is careful about:
//!
//! - **Every shell-out is bounded.** `gh` talks to the network; a hung request on
//!   the render loop is a frozen dashboard, so `bounded_output` spawns, polls
//!   `try_wait` against a deadline, and kills the child on overrun (the
//!   `cloudio::query_cloud_workspace_status` pattern).
//! - **Detection is cached and backed off.** Whether this repo can publish is a
//!   question about `gh`, auth and the remote — all of which change roughly never.
//!   The probe runs on a background thread and its cadence doubles while the
//!   answer holds still (AGENTS.md 12.8).
//! - **What GitHub knows, GitHub is asked.** The PR NUMBER is a durable fact about
//!   what Rudder did, so it is recorded. Whether that PR is still a draft is
//!   GitHub's answer and is re-derived, never loaded off disk (AGENTS.md 12.7).
